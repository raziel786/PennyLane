### Improvements that can be made:
- Checking across multiple devices and tablets and see it scales correctly
- Being able to add and delete products during `Edit`
- Improve swipable animation
- Being able to Finalize/Pay in the `In Detail` screen
- Add additional unit tests
- Instead of a search, possibly lazy load all the products and customers initially to reduce round trips
